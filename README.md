------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains Stable Diffusionâ€™s implementation in PyTorch.

## Updates

Yes, I am actively working on this project every day. I expect to
complete it by January. My plan is to implementing all the components
from scratch and load the pre-trained weights.

## Install

``` sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

``` python
from PIL import Image
from foundation.stable_diffusion import StableDiffusion

prompt = "holy young female battle robot flying award winning, portrait bust symmetry faded tetrachromacycolors arctic background tim hildebrandt wayne barlowe bruce pennington donato giancola larry elmore masterpiece trending on artstation cinematic composition beautiful lighting hyper detailed!!! 8 k oil on canva"

model = StableDiffusion(n_inference_steps=30)
images = model.generate(prompt)

pil_images = [Image.fromarray(image) for image in images]
pil_images[0]
```
